### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
Storing old projects here...

https://atarasov.ru - blog using vue and python, old project, just for tests. Open repo is [here](https://github.com/FiLoY/pub_atarasov). Maybe it's still working...

https://aatarasov.com/english2/ - app for learning english. This site also has telegram bot @my_smart_english_bot which sometimes(i don't know why, no time to fix) sends notifications. I divided it in microservices. Technologies: Python, Go, Django, Celery, gin, GORM, FastApi, mb I forgot something else. I am still working on it. All repos store privately on https://gitlab.com/. For testing site: login: test, pass: cXhc4303L1VJ.
